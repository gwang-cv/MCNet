# MCNet
-

Pytorch implementation of MCNet for IEEE/CAA JAS 2023 paper "[MCNet: Multiscale Clustering Network for Two-View Geometry Learning and Feature Matching](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10141546)", by Gang Wang and Yufei Chen.


Requirements
-
Please use Python 3.6, opencv-contrib-python (3.4.0.12) and Pytorch (>= 1.1.0). Other dependencies should be easily installed through pip or conda.
